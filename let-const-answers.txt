1. Var and let

	Var variables have a function scope, and can be redeclared while let variables cannot be redeclared and each declaration is limited to the code block that it's declared in.

2. Var and const

	Var variables can be reassigned, redeclared, and has a function scope while const variables cannot be reassigned or redeclared and are limited to the code block that they're declared in

3. Let and const

	Let variables can be reassigned while const variables cannot.

4. Hoisting

	Hoisting is when variables are treated as though they have been declared at the beginning of the code but they are not given the value until that declaration is reached. This is because var-declared variables are added to the window object. Functions are also hoisted.
